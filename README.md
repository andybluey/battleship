##Battleship
This is a side project I started for WDi 16 (which I spent most of my time for over the week), once finished with Project Zero. I tried to create an online version of battleship. Specifically, I wanted to get some basic game logic up and running and then use jQuery's drag and drop (which I found really cool). This is part of the Web Development Immersive 16 with General Assembly.

## Result
The drag and drop functionality works with the player at initial setup. I used ES6 to run through letters and set up the grid (not heroku friendly).

## How to view app
- Clone / fork my repo: https://github.com/andybluey/battleship

## Languages Used:
- Javascript
- JQuery
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Future Inclusions
- Add vertical drop - iterate through the letters to drop a ship vertically on a board.
- Better reset functionality.
- Better ship identifiers that will allow ships to be 'sunk'.
- Better checks on where ships are dropped (ie no overlap or falling off grid)
